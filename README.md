# Country Explorer

Explore country data with ease in this interactive project built with Vue 3 and the Composition API using TypeScript. Designed to pull data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), this application offers a visually rich and responsive experience in both light and dark modes. We've prioritized a polished, user-friendly interface to provide seamless browsing and information access for each country.

## Built with Modern Technologies & Best Practices

Throughout the project, we adhered to best practices and used the latest technologies to maximize performance and deliver a high-quality user experience. The application leverages **Vuetify** for a consistent and elegant UI, and weâ€™ve optimized code structure and interactions to ensure intuitive and efficient usability.

Our primary focus was to meet the exact requirements without extending beyond scope. However, there's ample potential for additional features, refinements, and improvements to further enhance functionality and prevent potential issues.
